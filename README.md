# Cows_And_Bulls_Prime
Hi! This is my term paper on the Bulls and Cows Prime project. I'm going to bring this game to perfection! :)
Game Mechanics:
1. Single-player mode: The player guesses the computer's number. A hint costs 50 points, and a win grants 100 points.
2. Two-player mode: Players take turns guessing the same number. The first to guess correctly wins 100 points.
3. Hints: Reveal one digit of the secret number (cycling through positions).
4. Input validation: Ensures guesses are 4 unique digits.
